Created this repo on the command line. Whee!

Each project is in a subfolder, so proj-pageserver is just a folder within this. I wanted to keep it on GitHub but not run out of private repositories, which is why I'm formatting this way. If that's no bueno, let me know and I can move to BitBucket or something else.
