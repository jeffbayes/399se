#  Google calendar authorization:
#      Returns us to the main /choose screen after inserting
#      the calendar_service object in the session state.  May
#      redirect to OAuth server first, and may take multiple
#      trips through the oauth2 callback function.
#
#  Protocol for use ON EACH REQUEST: 
#     First, check for valid credentials
#     If we don't have valid credentials
#         Get credentials (jump to the oauth2 protocol)
#         (redirects back to /choose, this time with credentials)
#     If we do have valid credentials
#         Get the service object
#
#  The final result of successful authorization is a 'service'
#  object.  We use a 'service' object to actually retrieve data
#  from the Google services. Service objects are NOT serializable ---
#  we can't stash one in a cookie.  Instead, on each request we
#  get a fresh serivce object from our credentials, which are
#  serializable. 
#
#  Note that after authorization we always redirect to /choose;
#  If this is unsatisfactory, we'll need a session variable to use
#  as a 'continuation' or 'return address' to use instead.
